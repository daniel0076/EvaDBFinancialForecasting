# EvaDB Financial Forecasting with Profiling

Please explore the interactive notebook here: [Financial Forecasting with Profiling](main.ipynb).

## The Profiling Module:

The implementation leverages Python's context manager, allowing for the seamless integration of profiling using Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) syntax. This approach not only simplifies the development of the profiling module but also provides a user-friendly and efficient means of profiling specific lines of code within EvaDB.

The profiling module records timestamps upon entering the context (`__enter__` is called) and calculates the elapsed time when exiting the context (in the `__exit__` function). By using the Python with statement, defining a section of code for profiling becomes remarkably straightforward. Within the with block, `__enter__` is invoked upon entering the scope, while `__exit__` is called when leaving the scope.
